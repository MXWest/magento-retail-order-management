## Overview

This guide discusses how you integrate with eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management to enable a Magento instance to:

-   Periodically synchronize product data with eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management (this includes product metadata, inventory, attributes, and attribute sets)
-   Map the Magento shipping method (such as `flatrate_flatrate`) to an eBay Enterprise shipping method
-   Specify valid ranges for stored value cards

### Understanding the Integration

The following figure shows a basic overview of the integration between Magento and eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management:

![Retail Order Management Overview](static/basic-overview.png)

Data flows work as follows:

1.  Product data (whose structure is defined by the XML feeds) flows as follows:
    1.  To the product hub.
    1.  Data is stored in both the data warehouse and order management system.
1.  Inventory data flows as follows:
    1.  Inventory is managed by the order management system.
    1.  Available inventory is communicated to storefront using the fulfillment hub.
1.  Order transactions flow as follows:
    1.  Requests to eBay Retail Order Management arrive through a secure gateway.
    1.  eBay interfaces route requests to the appropriate service: order service, inventory service, tax service, address validation service, or payment service.
    1.  Orders and inventory updates go to the order management system bidirectionally.
    1.  Ordered items can be processed by the fulfillment hub or by the fulfillment channel you select.

Note the following:

-   Batch processes are shown in the preceding figure as dashed lines. Batch processes run every 15 minutes provided your [Magento cron job](http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/ce18-and-ee113-installing#install-cron) is set up.
-   Fulfillment is beyond the scope of this document. eBay Enterprise can assist you understanding your fulfillment options.

### Services Provided by Magento and by eBay Enterprise

Magento enables you to:

-   Configure the eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management extension to communicate with eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management through its secure gateway.
-   Configure options to interact with the eBay Enterprise Platform (tax, payments, address validation, and so on).
-   If eBay Enterprise Payments is enabled, to authorize transactions.
-   Create products, attributes, attribute sets, and so on.
     You must update the XML feeds if you make changes to the structure of this data.

eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management performs the following:

-   Address validation
-   Tax calculation
-   Inventory management
-   If you enabled eBay Enterprise Payments, it performs the following:
    -   Capture
    -   Refund
    -   Cancel
-   Fulfillment (if you subscribed to it) You have several options for order fulfillment, all of which are beyond the scope of this document.

## Prerequisites

This section discusses general prerequisites.

### Intended Audience

The intended audience for this guide is System Integrators with extensive experience with Magento and XML programming experience.

### System Prerequisites

-   The eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management extension is compatible with Magento EE 1.13.1 and later.
    -   If you're running an earlier version of Magento EE, see [Upgrading to and Verifying Magento Community Edition 1.8 and Enterprise Edition 1.13â€”Part 1](http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/ce18-and-ee113-upgrading).
-   The extension requires a patch to core Magento's Address Model so that the address validation service can work effectively. If you do not have this patch, contact eBay Enterprise.
-   In addition to Magento's standard system requirements, the eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management Magento extension requires the XSL and OpenSSL extensions to PHP. (These are often, but not always, enabled by default.)
-   The Magento Payment Bridge must be set up in a secure environment that is [Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA DSS) compliant](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/pa-dss_v2.pdf).
-   The extension has been tested with PHP5.3.

### Required Information

You must have the following information from eBay Enterprise to start using eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management:

-   The eBay Enterprise mapping for the Magento shipping method (a typical Magento shipping method is `flatrate_flatrate`)
-   Valid number ranges for all the stored value cards your store accepts
-   API key
-   Store code

If you don't have all of this information, contact eBay Enterprise before continuing.

## Configuring XML for Batch Feeds

Batch feed XML files are used to import and update products (including attributes and attribute sets) in Magento. The XML specifies the structure and content of products; therefore, the XML for simple products is different than the XML for configurable products, and so on.

eBay Enterprise will initially assist you with setting up your XML. Before product import functions properly, all of the following must be true:

1.  The XML must be set up properly.
1.  The XML feeds must be uploaded to eBay Enterprise (subsequently, the Magento cron job looks for updates every 15 minutes).
1.  All required attributes and attribute sets must be set up in Magento. You or the Magento administrator must do this; it does not happen automatically.

See one of the following sections for more information:

-   [Batch Feed XML Compatibility With Magento Product Types](#batch-feed-xml-compatibility-with-magento-product-types)
-   [Sample Feed XML](#sample-feed-xml)
-   [Setting Up Required Attributes and Attribute Sets](#setting-up-required-attributes-and-attribute-sets)

### Batch Feed XML Compatibility With Magento Product Types

Magento supports the following product types:

-   Simple
-   Configurable
-   Downloadable
-   Virtual
-   Grouped
-   Bundled

The product type is specified in the eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management XML as follows:

```xml
<Attribute name="ProductType" operation_type="Add" is_list="false" dt="string">
Â Â  Â  <Value>Configurable</Value>
</Attribute>
```

The following table shows how the eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management extension supports Magento product types:

<td align="left"><p>A Magento administrator can create bundled products, but the behavior of bundled products is undefined and unsupported.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Note:** All products in the item master must specify the product type. An example is shown in Item Master Feed XML Example.

### Sample Feed XML

This section shows examples of the feed XML. Note that the following values have been changed in the examples:

-   `YOUR-CLIENT-ID` is substituted for the client ID assigned to you by eBay Enterprise
-   `YOUR-STORE-ID` is substituted for the store ID assigned to you by eBay Enterprise

The examples are very short intentionally; for example, the content master feed defines one product. They serve to illustrate the structure of the XML.

See the following examples

-   [Content Master Feed XML Example](#content-master-feed-xml-example)
-   [Item Master Feed XML Example](#item-master-feed-xml-example)

#### Content Master Feed XML Example

The following example has been edited and shortened to emphasize Magento-specific elements.

#### Item Master Feed XML Example

The following example has been edited and shortened to emphasize Magento-specific elements. Note the example of setting the required ProductType value.

### Setting Up Required Attributes and Attribute Sets

The following table shows the correlation between custom attributes and custom attribute sets in XML and where to set them up in Magento. Failure to create custom attribute sets in Magento, for example, means that all products imported use a default attribute set.

</table>

## Configuring Local XML

The eBay Retail Order Management extension ships with a sample configuration file â€” `magento-install-dir/app/etc/retailordermanagement.xml.sample` â€” that enables you to specify options such as:

-   eBay Enterprise Exchange mapping for the Magento shipping method.
-   Stored value card number ranges.
-   Whether or not to delete feed files on the eBay Enterprise server after they have been read.

Except for the option to delete feed files, all values are provided to you by eBay Enterprise.

`retailordermanagement.xml.sample` provided with the extension follows.

To configure the eBay Retail Order Management extension:

1.  Log in to your Magento server as a user with ownership of the Magento file system.
1.  Enter the following commands in the order shown:
    1.  `cd magento-install-dir/app/etc`
    1.  `cp retailordermanagement.xml.sample retailordermanagement.xml`
1.  Open `retailordermanagement.xml` in a text editor.

### Configuring Logging Options

This section discusses how to set options to log errors and exceptions to the `magento-install-dir/var/log` directory.

To set logging options:

1.  Log in to the Magento Admin Panel as an administrator.
1.  Click **System \> Configuration \> ADVANCED \> Developer**.
1.  To change the scope of your settings, from the **Current Configuration Scope** list on the left, click the appropriate option. For example, to configure options for store view scope, click the name of a store view.
1.  In the right pane, click the **Log Settings** tab to expand it. The following figure shows an example:

### Scheduling Batch Feeds

The eBay Enterprise Retail Order Management uses your Magento EE cron job to update feeds every 15 minutes. Provided your cron job is set up, there is no additional configuration required.

For more information about setting up your Magento cron job, see [Setting Up Cron Jobs in the Magento Knowledge Base](http://www.magentocommerce.com/knowledge-base/entry/ce18-and-ee113-installing#install-cron).

Warning: These jobs were not built to be run in parallel. Be sure to configure cron to avoid running more than one import job at a time. (One way to do this is to use `cron.sh`, not `cron.php` to trigger the jobs.)
