## Introduction

The Address Validation service ensures that complete and accurate customer address information is collected at the time of order. Should an address fail validation, the customer is presented with a configurable number of alternative addresses.

In checkout, shipping addresses (including those used for both billing and shipping) are validated. In the customer's Address Book, all addresses are validated, as any address may be selected as a shipping address during checkout.
