## Introduction

The Magento Retail Order Management Extension's Customer Service Tools enables simple and direct order service capabilities to be carried out by customer service representatives for phone-in customers.

Customer service representatives will be able to place an order on behalf of the customer via the Magento Admin, with their Magento Admin username submitted with the order as the Representative ID.

The extension is pre-integrated with the Retail Order Management Customer Service Tool, allowing users of that tool to seamlessly and securely log into the Magento Admin to place orders on behalf of customer as described above. When using the Retail Order Management Customer Service Tool, the customer service representative's username from that tool will be submitted with the order as the Representative ID.

| Important |
|:----------|
| While customer service representatives may place orders using the Magento Admin, they should not use the Magento Admin to cancel or edit orders as those changes will not reflect on the Retail Order Management OMS. |
