# US20711 Display Order History from Web Services

## Terms
1. **Order History** appears in a Magento Customer's Account page
2. **Order Detail** is the set of data presented to the user for one specific order. Currently its source is a hybrid of data taken from the Web Service Response and the Magento database.
2. **Web Services** refers to the ROM API which provides order details. Given a customer ID and the appropriate credentials, a set of information about orders the customer has placed within that context is returned.
3. **Cache** Results of a Inquiry are cached within a session. Performance is enhanced by avoiding duplicate calls to the API service.

## Objective
Order history for Magento ROM Extension should present information obtained from Web Service Order Summary calls. Currently, only the set of orders that intersects with orders that are present in the Magento web store database are shown to the customer.

Rather than display _any_ information exclusive to the Magento database, the order "Order detail page should use order details API call, not Magento."

## Caching
Responses from the Web Service are cached directly in an array within the helper (at it's a Singleton, it's remembered during the same request session).

## Displaying _Recent Orders_ using Order Service Details

1. Whether you are registering as a new customer, or logging in as an existing customer, the Override for "Recent" (`EbayEnterprise_Eb2cOrder_Overrides_Block_Order_Recent`) is instantiated.
2. `Recent`'s constructor invokes `Mage::helper('eb2corder')->getCurCustomerOrders` which first checks to see if the requested information is already present in the the Order Summary Cache (using `$helper->getCachedOrderSummaryResponse`). If found, it's returned, if not ...
3. OrderSummaryRequest is made in the form via Web Services. The call is: 

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<OrderSummaryRequest xmlns="http://api.gsicommerce.com/schema/checkout/1.0">
  <OrderSearch>
    <CustomerId>000087</CustomerId>
  </OrderSearch>
</OrderSummaryRequest>
```
_Empty Responses_ are not cached.

## Displaying _My Orders_ using Order Service Details
1. `EbayEnterprise_Eb2cOrder_Overrides_Block_Order_History` is instantiated.
2. Its constructor invokes `Mage::helper('eb2corder')->getCurCustomerOrders` .
3. `sales.order.history` is rendered.

## Parsing an Empty Response for Order Service Details
If no orders are present in the OMS, the Web Service will return an empty response:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<OrderSummaryResponse xmlns="http://api.gsicommerce.com/schema/checkout/1.0"/>
```

1. The helper is used to update the Response Cache. `$helper->updateOrderSummaryResponseCache`
2. Customer/Order/Search.php parseResponse return an array(0)
3. The response is rendered on the Customer's Dashboard
4. _Empty Responses_ are not cached.

## Parsing an OrderSummaryResponse

```
<OrderSummaryResponse>
  <OrderSummary id="order-20141126204113273710814" orderType="SALES"
                 modifiedTime="2014-12-11T15:37:59+00:00"
                 cancellable="true">
      <CustomerOrderId>0005410401684</CustomerOrderId>
      <CustomerId>000081</CustomerId>
      <OrderDate>2014-11-26T20:22:35+00:00</OrderDate>
      <Status>Scheduled</Status>
      <OrderTotal>58.30</OrderTotal>
   </OrderSummary>
</OrderSummaryResponse>
```

The response taken from the Web Service is converted to an array of Varien_Objects by `EbayEnterprise_Eb2cOrder_Model_Customer_Order_Search::parseResponse.`

The array conversion includes adding array elements that are Magento-like for subsequent use by Magento. The mapping is:

* OrderTotal => grand_total
* Status => status (as mapped by mapEb2cOrderStatusToMage)


The express purpose of this mapping is to allow the usual Magento getters to work in the user-facing templates.

The array is temporary. The `id` of each newly created Varien_Object in the array need only be a unique integer.

## Order Summary Request Process

### Previous Version 
Previously, all Order Summaries received via Web Services were mapped to existing Magento Orders. Any order _not_ matching an existing Magento orders was ignored. The resulting collection was saved in a ``EbayEnterprise_Eb2cOrder_Model_Resource_Summary_Order_Collection``, which extended ``Mage_Sales_Model_Resource_Order_Collection``.

### New Version
All Order Summaries receive via Web Services will map directly to an ``EbayEnterprise_Eb2cOrder_Model_Resource_Summary_Order_Collection``, which no longer extends ``Mage_Sales_Model_Resource_Order_Collection``, but is simply a collection of Varien_Objects.

The Varien_Objects in turn, will contain a valid Magento Sales Order if one exists in Magento. This is used for subsequent rendering.

For the ``Recent`` view of orders (as seen on the Customer's Dashboard), a subset of orders is returned.

### Reorder Link
Is applicable only if the order exists in Magento. This was unclear in the User Story, so it's been earmarked as a "stretch goal."

### New Templates
New templates are required. Previously, all fields were adapted to Mage-ready orders, and this is no longer the case. Additionally, fields are completely removed (Ship-To, Reorder) necessitating new templates.

* `template/sales/order/history.phtml` => template/sales/order/ebayenterprise_history.phtml
* `template/sales/order/recent.phtml` => template/sales/order/ebayenterprise_recent.phtml

## Layout Updates
Required to accomodate new templates.

## Order Detail Request Process
### Previous Version
Previously, all Order Detail rquested were processed by the default Magento Sales Order Controller which required a valid Magento Order to function. Additional information provided by ROM Web Services was injected before rendering by using Magento event observers.

### New Version
The new version implements a new controller action in the (already existing) Eb2cOrder OrderController. This is because 'view' has already been reserved for the standard Magento Order view (which uses the internal database identifier and not the Magento Order Id (which is displayed to the user). 

The action 'romviewAction' is added, which takes as its argument the Magento Order Id.

#### OrderCreateRequest Note
The OrderCreateRequest is sending the standard Magento view order id URL. This means that the View URL returned by Web Services is the standard view, not the web services view.

## Code and Configuration To Remove
* No need for event observers for viewing (we're using our own Controller and templating)
* No need for elaborate merging of Web Service Detail with Magento Sales Orders - Detail.php and associated tests are greatly simplified.
* May be able to simplify the 'clone' order objec type (as with above, since we don't need elaborate merging.)
